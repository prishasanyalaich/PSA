HI! I AM PRISHA!

I'm a first-year undergraduate student at KIIT University.

I've been majoring in biotechnology and it made me realize that I love the "technology" part more than the "bio" part.

Although I'm a newbie my interests include Machine Learning, Bioinformatics, and Data Science

Languages known are Python (and many more to come)
